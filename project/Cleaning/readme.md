# Cleaning process
Here you can find the material from our own cleaning process.

To perform the cleaning yourself, you need to install deepface from PyPI beforehand.

## supercleaning_of_imdb_clean.py

This Python file was used to perfom the cleaning of the IMDB_clean image folders.
The file needs to be put into the same folder hierarchy as the IMDB_clean folder "imdb-clean-1024".
To do the cleaning, enter the following into your commandline:

> python Supercleaning_of_imdb_clean.py

This is the outcome of the cleaning: several directories are made where the pictures will be sorted into. Supercleaning_of_imdb_clean is the folder containing the following subfolders:
- imdb_badpics contains 2 folders: noFace and multipleFaces
- imdb_superclean contains the cleaned pictures. This is the product of our cleaning process and what we consider our newly cleaned dataset.

[imdb_clean](https://github.com/yiminglin-ai/imdb-clean) - This is where the original IMDB_clean can be downloaded from. Through this process we have obtained the mentioned "imdb-clean-1024" folder.

Please note: the cleaning process can be very time consuming, when there are as many pictures as in the imdb_clean;)


## Csv-cleaning-test.py, Csv-cleaning-train.py and Csv-cleaning-valid.py

These python files were used to clean the corresponding csv-files containing metainformation about the images.
For every split we have a different file. To perform the cleaning, take the original csv-files (imdb_test_new_1024.csv, imdb_train_new_1024.csv, imdb_valid_new_1024.csv) from the [imdb_clean](https://github.com/yiminglin-ai/imdb-clean) process (which we performed beforehand) and put them into a folder named "yiminglin_csvs".
Put the cleaning files in the same folder hierarchy as the yiminglin_csvs folder. Then enter the following command into your commandline:
> python Csv-cleaning-test.py

> python Csv-cleaning-train.py

> python Csv-cleaning-valid.py

## Already cleaned dataset

We also provide you the already cleaned dataset in a zip-file. It contains the pictures that remained after doing the above.
It can be found [here](https://myshare.uni-osnabrueck.de/f/c7cc8fd26472494f95d8/).
